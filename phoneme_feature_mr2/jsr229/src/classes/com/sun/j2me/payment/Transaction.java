/**
 * A transaction holds the state and information about payment. It's state 
 * is updated by the associated transaction processor. 
 * <p>
 * There are the following predefined states:
 * <ul>
 *      <li><code>ENTERED</code> - the payment has been initiated by the 
 *              application
 *      </li>
 *      <li><code>UPDATE</code> - the transaction should be updated from the
 *              update URL
 *      </li>
 *      <li><code>ASSIGNED</code> - the transaction has been assigned to the 
 *              payment adapter instance associated with the user selected 
 *              provider
 *      </li>
 *      <li><code>SUCCESSFUL</code> - the payment has been successfully finished
 *      </li>
 *      <li><code>FAILED</code> - the payment failed because of errors
 *      </li>
 *      <li><code>REJECTED</code> - the payment has been rejected by the user
 *      </li>
 *      <li><code>DISCARDED</code> - the transaction should be silently 
 *              discarded by the payment module
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <code>Transaction</code> class can be extended by some adapter specific
 * subclass, which can hold more information about payment and can define some
 * adapter specific states. For this purpose, there is a special constructor 
 * which initiates the transaction from the information provided by the 
 * transaction given as a parameter. There is also defined the 
 * <code>ADAPTER_SPECIFIC</code> constant, which should be used to number 
 * adapter specific states (<code>ADAPTER_SPECIFIC</code>, 
 * <code>ADAPTER_SPECIFIC + 1</code>, <code>ADAPTER_SPECIFIC + 2</code>...).
