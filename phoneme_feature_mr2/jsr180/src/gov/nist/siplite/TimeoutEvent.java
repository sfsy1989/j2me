/**
 * This class represents an Timeout event that is passed from a SipProvider to
 * its SipListener. A specific message may need retransmitted on a specific
 * transaction numerous times before it is acknowledged by the receiver. If the
 * message is not acknowledged after a specified period in the underlying
 * implementation the transaction will expire, this occurs usually
 * after seven retransmissions. The mechanism to alert an application that a
 * message for a an underlying transaction needs retransmitted (i.e. 200OK) or
 * an underlying transaction has expired is a Timeout Event.
 * <p>
 * A Timeout Event can be of two different types, namely:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Timeout#RETRANSMIT}
 * <li>{@link Timeout#TRANSACTION}
 * </ul>
 * A TimeoutEvent contains the following information:
 * <ul>
 * <li>source - the SipProvider that sent the TimeoutEvent.
 * <li>transaction - the transaction that this Timeout applies to.
 * <li>isServerTransaction - boolean indicating whether the
 * transaction refers to
 * a client or server transaction.
 * <li>timeout - indicates what type of {@link Timeout} occurred.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see Timeout

 * @since v1.1
