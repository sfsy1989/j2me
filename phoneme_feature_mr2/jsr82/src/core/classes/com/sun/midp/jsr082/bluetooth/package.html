    <TITLE>JSR82 Bluetooth Porting Interface</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
Porting interface for device inquiry, service discovery, remote device name
retrieval, access to local SDDB, authentication and encryption.
<p>
Design Overview
<p>
This package contains classes which are to be subclassed or directly modified
during porting to various native Bluetooth stack implementations.
GenericBluetoothStack java class and CBlueZStack C++ class are provided as a
reference implementation which was tested with the official Linux Bluetooth
stack.
<p>
Central to the package is the abstract BluetoothStack class, which provides
services for device inquiry, remote device name retrieval, access to local
service discovery database (SDDB), authentication and encryption.
<p>
Device inquiry is asynchronous operations, meaning that the corresponding class
method call is non-blocking, and notification is used to deliver data when it
arrives. All other methods are blocking, including retrieval of a remote device
name (which is actually processed asynchronously in a different thread).
<p>
It is assumed that the native stack implementation provides methods to poll
for events such as inquiry result and remote name result, and returns such
events in binary form (the format is stack-specific). This binary data is then
transformed into Java event classes, which are processed accordingly.
<p>
Separate threads are used for event polling and event delivery. This allows
to continue receiving and storing events in cases such as when processing of
a certain event can only be ended with receiving another event (e.g. to
simulate synchronous remote name retreival).
<p>
A generic implementation of the BluetoothStack is available,
which relies on Bluetooth HCI interface for device inquiry and remote name
retrieval. GenericBluetoothStack should generally be used as a base for the
port, unless the native Bluetooth stack provides more convenient API for
operations such as device inquiry, remote name retrieval, authentication and
encryption.
