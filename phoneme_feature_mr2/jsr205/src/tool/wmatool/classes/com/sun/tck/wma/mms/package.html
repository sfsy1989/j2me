    <H1>J2SE MMS Message Connection Implementation</H1>
    <P>
      Implementation classes for the MMS Message Connection layered
      on a <code>DatagramPacket</code> low-level transport.
    </P>

    <P>
      A single class is shared by the J2ME client and the J2SE service to allow
      formatted messages to be transmitted across platforms.
    </P>
    <P>
      <code>com.sun.midp.io.j2me.mms.MMSPacket</code> provides the interfaces to
      get/set fielded data packed into a binary datagram message.
    </P>

    <H2>Configuration File</H2>
    <P>
      Properties can be set in a configuration file called "connections.prop" in
      the current working directory to override the built-in default values.
      Such values include the phone number of the device and the input/output
      port numbers for receiving/sending datagrams, respectively. A phone number
      may also configured in order to identify the address of the sender.
    </P>
    <P>
      These are the default MMS configurations in <code>connections.prop</code>:

#
# The datagram host is the name of the client or /target device. Messages are
# sent to and/or received from this client. The host can be an alias that maps
# in /etc/hosts (UNIX/Linux systems) to a a real client device name. The alias
# can also be mapped to the IP address of the device under test.
#
DatagramHost=wmadatagramhost
#
# The phone number starts with "+" and is followed by a number of digits
# (e.g.: +5551234). The phone number represents the number of a device that
# would contact the MIDP code under test. The phone number is the same across
# all protocols.
#
PhoneNumber=+5551234

#
# MMS properties -- These properties are used by MMSMessageConnector.
#
# The port numbers represent the server-side datagram ports. These values
# will be opposite to the "in" and "out" ports in the XML properties file
# of the client (MIDP) code.
#
# The "reply-to" application ID is not real, but simply representative of
# a real-world application ID string. Normally, this would be the path to
# the application that would process the message data sent to the server
# (or, in this case, to the tool code.).

MMSDatagramPortOut=33300
MMSDatagramPortIn=33301
MMSReplyToAppID=com.sun.mms.MMSTest
